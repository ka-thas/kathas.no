                    Here are some of the projects I have worked on. Most of the
                    source code is on my
                    <a href="https://github.com/ka-thas"> GitHub </a>

                <p>
                    This is a virtual plant that I made using JS, HTML and CSS.
                    It's essentially a Tamagotchi but with only one need: water.
                    The plant will grow while it has water or die if it doesn't
                    get water for a long time.
                </p>

                <h2>Eco system simulation</h2>
                <p>
                    Really mesmerizing to watch. You should bet on a winner and
                    see the result. Is's probably as deterministic as using a
                    randint function? <br />
                    Here's a screenshot of the simulation:

                <h2>Electric scooter map</h2>
                <p>
                    It shows nearby electric scooters on a map and their battery
                    level.
